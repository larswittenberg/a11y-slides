# Dependency and Security Audit (Offline Environment)

## Summary
- Performed dependency cleanup by replacing the deprecated `ncp` and standalone `rimraf` dev dependencies with native Node.js file utilities.
- Attempted to run automated security and update checks (`npm audit`, `yarn npm audit`, `npm outdated`, `npm-check-updates`) but all requests were blocked by the execution environment's proxy (HTTP 403).
- Added small utility scripts to keep the existing build workflows functional without the removed packages.

## Commands Executed
| Command | Purpose | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm audit --production` | Check production dependency vulnerabilities | Failed – npm requires a lockfile and remote registry access. |
| `yarn npm audit --severity high` | Yarn-based audit focusing on high severity issues | Failed – HTTP 403 response from proxy. |
| `npm outdated` | Inspect available package updates | Failed – HTTP 403 response from proxy. |
| `npx npm-check-updates` | Discover latest versions and detect breaking upgrades | Failed – HTTP 403 response from proxy. |
| `yarn install` | Refresh `node_modules` after dependency edits | Failed – HTTP 403 response from proxy. |

Refer to the terminal output in the development session for the exact error traces.

## Manual Dependency Notes
- `@marp-team/marp-cli@^2.2.1` remains the sole dev dependency. Updating it further requires online access to confirm the latest stable release and review changelog for breaking changes.
- Removed `ncp` (deprecated) and `rimraf` (superseded by `fs.cpSync` and `fs.rmSync`) from direct dependencies. Runtime copies bundled via transitive dependencies (for example, through `puppeteer-core`) remain untouched.

## Recommended Next Steps (with Network Access)
1. Restore registry connectivity or supply a mirror that accepts audit/update requests.
2. Rerun the audit and update commands listed above.
3. Inspect the changelog for `@marp-team/marp-cli` before applying any major version upgrade to avoid breaking CLI flags or output formats.
4. Re-run the build scripts (`yarn clean`, `yarn deck`, `yarn pdf`) to ensure the new native file utilities behave as expected across platforms.
